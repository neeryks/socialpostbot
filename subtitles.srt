1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,645
Cannot give up.
Most of you are

2
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,468
happy to be losers
part time. You want

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,057
to escape. You
don't want to lose

4
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:11,787
her anymore. But
then that new video

5
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:13,422
game comes out.
I'll just play the

6
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,152
video game. I'll
just be a loser for

7
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:16,788
two more weeks.
Then I'll get back

8
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:18,424
to trying to escape
the matrix. It

9
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,013
doesn't work that
way because you

10
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:21,695
jump in and out of
complacency from

11
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:22,817
I'm happy to be a
loser,

12
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:24,640
do loser things to
I can't be a loser

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,229
anymore. When you
jump in and out,

14
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:27,725
you never get
momentum. Cannot

15
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:29,361
quit. You cannot
give up. You need

16
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,740
that momentum to
break free.

17
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,601
And a rocket is
flying out towards

18
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,623
the moon to escape
the atmosphere. It

19
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:36,378
doesn't *******
pause halfway up

20
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:38,347
the sky, does it?
No, it keeps going,

21
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,368
or finally in the
right place at the

22
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,496
right time. You are
the only person who

23
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,624
can make this work,
and you're also the

24
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,380
only person who can
**** this up.
